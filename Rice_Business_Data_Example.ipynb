   "source": "# Rice Business Stock Market Data - Python Example\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to access and analyze stock market data from the Rice Business Data Portal using Python and DuckDB queries.\n\n## 📋 What You'll Learn\n\n- How to connect to Rice Business stock market data\n- SQL queries with DuckDB syntax\n- Stock analysis examples\n- Data visualization with pandas and matplotlib\n\n## 🔑 Getting Your Access Token\n\n1. Visit the [Rice Business Data Portal](https://data-portal.rice-business.org)\n2. Enter your `@rice.edu` email address\n3. Check your email for the **access token**\n4. Use that access token in the code below\n\n**Note**: The access token is the same token you use to log into the web portal!\n\n## 🔐 **Recommended: Store Your Token as a Secret in Google Colab**\n\nFor security, we recommend storing your access token as a **secret** in Google Colab instead of pasting it directly in the code:\n\n### **How to Add a Secret:**\n1. **Click the 🔑 key icon** on the left sidebar in Colab\n2. **Click \"Add new secret\"**\n3. **Name:** `RICE_ACCESS_TOKEN`\n4. **Value:** Paste your access token from the email\n5. **Enable notebook access** by toggling the switch\n\n### **Benefits:**\n- ✅ **Secure** - Token won't be visible in your notebook\n- ✅ **Shareable** - You can share notebooks without exposing your token\n- ✅ **Professional** - Best practice for sensitive credentials\n\nIf you don't set up a secret, you can still paste your token directly in the code below (look for `ACCESS_TOKEN = \"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE\"`).\n\n---"
